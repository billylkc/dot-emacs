* dot-emacs

Goals:
- Simple: Main config in one single file, with detailed explanations in comments
- Robust: Use [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#configuration-reproducibility][straight.el]] to freeze package versions. See
  [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#configuration-reproducibility][configuration-reproducibility]]

It adopts the same idea in [[https://yiufung.net/post/pure-emacs-lisp-init-skeleton/][my post on pure Emacs-Lisp config]], except that
~straight.el~ is used to replace ~package.el~ to enhance reproducibility.
